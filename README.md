# Next-Word-Predictor-using-NLP

Writing long sentences is bit boring, however with text prediction within the keyboard technology has created this easy. Next Word Prediction is in addition referred to as Language Modeling. It's the endeavor of predicting what word comes straightaway. It's one in every of the key assignments of human language technology and has various applications. Long short time memory formula can perceive past text and predict the words which can be useful for the user to border sentences.
The model will consider the last word of a particular sentence and predict the next possible word. We will be using methods of natural language processing, language modeling, and deep learning. We will start by analyzing the data followed by the pre-processing of the data. We will then tokenize this data and finally build the deep learning model. The deep learning model will be built using bidirectional LSTM’s.

About NLP -

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that aims to make computers understand and interpret the written text as well as spoken human language in a similar way as humans do. NLP has undergone tremendous improvements due to the advancement in deep learning and neural networks in the past few years. It finds applications in text processing, machine translation, and speech recognition. However, due to the complexity and size of the language models, it becomes extremely difficult to deploy and run these models on mobile and other edge devices. This is due to the limited resources available when dealing with such devices. However, federated learning comes to the rescue in this scenario, providing the ability to train language models on the user device itself without compromising the users’ data privacy.
